🌌 **Overview**  
Trōṇa Siddhāntam proposes a novel framework to understand the universe as a continuous medium of resonant waves called the **Tarangi**.  
All physical phenomena—particles, forces, space, and time—emerge from patterns of wave resonance and dynamic plucking within this substrate.

---

⚛️ **Foundational Premise**  
Reality is fundamentally wave-like, always in motion, and embedded in a continuous medium.  
Rather than discrete particles or static fields, **everything is flow**—structured as dynamic **resonant knots** in the Tarangi.  
This worldview reinterprets physics through resonance, emergence, and sustained vibrational interactions.

🌐 **Core Concepts**

### I. Tarangi  
The universal wave medium, omnipresent and continuous. All phenomena exist as fluctuations within this field.

### II. Resonant Knots (Trōṇas)  
Localized, stable, self-sustaining wave configurations that give rise to what we perceive as particles or persistent forms.

### III. Plucking Mechanism  
The dynamic act of interaction — where energy input disturbs and excites specific resonant modes, creating new knots or modifying existing ones.

### IV. Emergence of Space and Time  
Space and time are not fundamental; they arise from wave relationships — the timing, spacing, and interference of resonances.

### V. Entropy and Thermodynamics  
A wave-centric interpretation of thermodynamics where knot stability and decay map to energetic dispersion and entropic flow.

🔬 **Reimagined/Contrasted Concepts**

| Standard Concept         | Trōṇa Siddhāntam’s View                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Particles               | Stable resonant wave knots                         |
| Force fields            | Interference-driven plucking and wave dynamics     |
| Spacetime               | Emergent from relational wave resonance            |
| Quantum uncertainty     | A byproduct of knot instability and resonance decay|
| Gravity                 | Macro-resonant curvature within the Tarangi        |

🌌 **Overview**  
Trōṇa Siddhāntam proposes a novel framework to understand the universe as a continuous medium of resonant waves called the **Tarangi**.  
All physical phenomena—particles, forces, space, and time—emerge from patterns of **plucks (Trōṇas)** and **resonant knots (Dhruva)** formed within this wave-substrate.

---

⚛️ **Foundational Premise**  
Reality is fundamentally wave-like, always in motion, and embedded in a continuous medium.  
Rather than discrete particles or static fields, **everything is flow**—driven by dynamic **Trōṇas (plucks)** which create, disturb, or dissolve **Dhruvas (resonant knots)** in the Tarangi.

🌐 **Core Concepts**

### I. Tarangi  
The universal wave medium, omnipresent and continuous. All phenomena exist as structured fluctuations within this medium.

### II. Dhruva (Resonant Knots)  
Stable, self-sustaining configurations of resonance—akin to particles or persistent structures—held together through equilibrium in the wave field.

### III. Trōṇa (Pluck)  
A dynamic excitation — the act of disturbing the Tarangi to trigger or shift resonance, creating new Dhruvas or transforming existing ones.

### IV. Emergence of Space and Time  
Space and time emerge from patterns of relational wave propagation, as plucks and knots define reference and duration.

### V. Entropy and Thermodynamics  
Thermodynamic behavior is seen as a natural outcome of the stability, decay, and transformation of Dhruvas under sustained or dissipative plucking.

🔬 **Reimagined/Contrasted Concepts**

| Standard Concept         | Trōṇa Siddhāntam’s View                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Particles               | Dhruvas — stable resonant wave knots               |
| Interactions/Forces     | Trōṇas — plucking events in the Tarangi            |
| Spacetime               | Emergent from relational resonance and timing      |
| Quantum uncertainty     | Result of knot instability and pluck interference  |
| Gravity                 | Large-scale curving resonances in the Tarangi      |

🔍 **Recent Insights / Highlights**  
- Clarified **Dhruva–Trōṇa distinction** as core to the system’s dynamics.  
- Proposed outer galactic boundaries as **resonance shells**, not merely gravitational edges.  
- Reframed entropy as **dissolution of sustained knot patterns** due to unresolved or chaotic plucks.

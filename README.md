## üåå Overview

Tr≈ç·πáa SiddhƒÅntam proposes a novel framework to understand the universe:  
**Everything is composed of waves resonating in a fundamental medium called the Tarangi.**  

Particles, forces, space, time, gravity, and even consciousness emerge naturally from these wave interactions.

> *This is a conceptual and exploratory model under active development. Contributions, critiques, and formalizations are warmly welcome.*

## ‚öõÔ∏è Foundational Premise: Only Waves Exist

- Reality is built from a continuous, all-permitting wave substrate ‚Äî **the Tarangi**.  
- There are no fundamental particles, fields, or spacetime; all observed phenomena are emergent patterns of intersecting, resonating waves.

## üåê Core Concepts

### I. Emergence of Particles and Fields

1. **Particles = Resonant Knots (Tr≈ç·πáas)**  
   Stable intersections of multiple waves form coherent oscillation zones ‚Äî these knots correspond to particles.

2. **Fields = Statistical Recurrence Zones**  
   What physics calls fields are zones where specific wave modes recur with high probability.

---

### II. Forces and Interactions

3. **Forces = Resonance Adjustments**  
   All forces arise from phase interactions of waves:  
   - *Phase-locking* corresponds to binding forces.  
   - *Phase-breaking* corresponds to scattering or decay.

4. **Charge = Symmetry of Coupling**  
   Charge and quantum numbers emerge as harmonic phase symmetries. Antiparticles correspond to phase inversions.

### III. Space, Gravity, and Time

5. **Spacetime = Wave Medium**  
   Space is the structured propagation of waves in Tarangi ‚Äî waves **are** space.

6. **Gravity = Wave Trajectory Bending**  
   Massive knots create zones of constructive interference that bend other wave trajectories ‚Äî experienced as gravity.

7. **Time = Entropic Expansion**  
   Time is emergent from increasing complexity and spreading resonance ‚Äî the "arrow of time" reflects this entropic unfolding.

### IV. Cosmic Phenomena

8. **Black Holes = Resonant Traps**  
   Self-reinforcing oscillation regions trap incoming waves; Hawking radiation is interpreted as loss of edge coherence.

9. **Dark Matter = Non-Electromagnetic Resonant Knots**  
   Stable wave knots that don‚Äôt couple electromagnetically but affect gravitational trajectories.

10. **Dark Energy = Residual Tension**  
    Primordial wave tension unfolds the universe on cosmic scales.

| Standard Concept                | Pluck Theory View                                       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Quantum Field Theory           | No fundamental fields; only wave recurrence zones      |
| Mass (Standard Model / Higgs) | Mass = trapped wave energy; no Higgs field required    |
| Gravity (General Relativity)   | Not spacetime curvature; wave trajectory bending       |
| Time                          | Emergent entropy; not fundamental dimension            |
| Collapse (Copenhagen)          | No collapse; only wave reconfiguration on measurement |
| Superposition                 | Built into internal resonance structure                 |
| Entanglement                 | Shared phase geometry across the substrate             |
| E = mc¬≤                      | Mass = localized wave energy; equation retained but reinterpreted |

## üîç Recent Insights: Light, Gravity, and Particles

- **Light and Gravity as Waves in Tarangi:** Light and gravity are manifestations of the same fundamental wave substrate. Light is the traveling wave itself, while particles emerge as localized resonant ‚Äúknots‚Äù formed through wave interactions.

- **Knots Form Upon Interaction:** Rather than particles being standalone ‚Äúknots‚Äù traveling alone, knots form at points of wave interference or interaction‚Äîespecially near observers or matter‚Äîgiving rise to measurable quantum effects.

- **Wave-Only Reality:** The wave substrate (Tarangi) carries energy intrinsically. Knots are not separate entities but stable patterns in the wave field, dynamically emerging and dissipating through resonance and observation.

- **Unified Picture:** This interpretation unifies light, gravity, and particles as different expressions of wave resonance dynamics, emphasizing that observation and interaction play key roles in particle formation.

These ideas continue to evolve and invite deeper mathematical formalization and experimental exploration.

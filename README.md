# Trōṇa Siddhāntam (Pluck Theory)

*A Unified Wave-Resonance Ontology of Reality*

---

Trōṇa Siddhāntam proposes a new way to understand the universe: everything is made of waves resonating in a fundamental medium called the Tarangi. Particles, forces, space, time, and even gravity emerge naturally from these wave interactions.

## 🌌 0. Foundational Premise: Only Waves Exist

- Reality is built from a continuous wave-permitting substrate — the **Tarangi**.
- There are no particles, fields, or spacetime as fundamental objects.
- All observed phenomena are patterns of intersecting, resonating waves.

## ⚛️ I. Emergence of Particles and Fields

### 1. Particles = Resonant Knots (Trōṇas)
- Particles are stable intersections of multiple waves (constructive interference).
- Each "particle" is a traveling knot — a coherent oscillation zone.

### 2. Fields = Statistical Recurrence Zones
- What physics calls “fields” are zones where specific wave modes recur.
- Fields are not fundamental; they are resonance probability regions in the Tarangi.

## 🌐 II. Forces and Interactions

### 3. Forces = Resonance Adjustments
- All forces are resonance phase interactions:
  - Phase-locking = binding.
  - Phase-breaking = scattering or decay.

### 4. Charge = Symmetry of Coupling
- Charge and quantum numbers are harmonic phase symmetries.
- Antiparticles are phase inversions.

## ⏳ III. Space, Gravity, and Time

### 5. Spacetime = Wave Medium
- Space is not a container. It is the structured propagation of waves in the Tarangi.
- Nothing “moves through” space — waves **are** space.

### 6. Gravity = Wave Trajectory Bending
- Massive knots create zones of constructive interference.
- Other waves bend through these regions: this is gravity.

### 7. Time = Entropic Expansion
- Time is not a dimension — it's the increasing complexity of wave entanglement.
- “The arrow of time” = spreading resonance.

## 🌠 IV. Cosmic Phenomena

### 8. Black Holes = Resonant Traps
- Self-reinforcing oscillation regions that trap incoming waves.
- Hawking radiation = loss of edge coherence.

### 9. Dark Matter = Non-EM Resonant Knots
- Stable wave knots that don’t couple electromagnetically.
- Affect gravitational trajectories.

### 10. Dark Energy = Residual Tension
- Space has primordial wave tension.
- This unfolds the universe at large scales.

## 🔬 V. Physics Concepts Reimagined

| **Standard Concept**                     | **Pluck Theory View**                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quantum Field Theory                     | No fundamental fields; only wave recurrence zones.                      |
| Mass (Standard Model / Higgs)            | Mass = trapped wave energy; not Higgs-generated.                        |
| Gravity (General Relativity)             | Not curvature; trajectory bending due to interference.                  |
| Time                                     | Emergent entropy; not a fundamental axis.                               |
| Collapse (Copenhagen Interpretation)     | No collapse — only wave reconfiguration on measurement.                 |
| Superposition                            | Built into internal resonance structure.                                |
| Entanglement                             | Shared phase geometry across substrate (no spooky action).              |
| E = mc²                                  | Mass = localized wave energy; equation remains, but reinterpreted.      |

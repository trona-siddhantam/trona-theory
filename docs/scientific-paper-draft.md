## Abstract

We propose a unified ontological framework in which all physical entities — particles, fields, forces, spacetime, and time — emerge from intersecting and resonating wave structures within a continuous medium, referred to as the **Tarangi**. This theory, termed **Trōṇa Siddhāntam** or **Pluck Theory**, reinterprets the foundations of quantum field theory, general relativity, and thermodynamics using a single underlying principle: stable wave interference gives rise to all observable structures in nature. The framework offers explanations for mass, charge, gravity, time, and quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, while also suggesting potential experimental directions to validate or falsify its claims.

## 1. Introduction

The Standard Model and General Relativity have had extraordinary predictive success, yet remain conceptually disconnected. Quantum mechanics retains unresolved interpretational issues, while phenomena like dark matter, dark energy, and the nature of mass remain elusive.

**Trōṇa Siddhāntam** offers a unifying ontology that treats everything — matter, energy, space, and time — as emergent from the interaction of waves in a background medium. Unlike string theory or quantum loop gravity, it does not posit new dimensions or particles, but instead reinterprets known ones through **wave geometry and resonance**.

## 2. Core Ontological Assumptions

- **Tarangi**: A continuous, non-material, wave-permitting substrate that supports oscillations of all scales.
- **Waves Are Primary**: There are no particles, fields, or spacetime as fundamental objects — only waves.
- **Trōṇas**: Localized, self-sustaining resonance knots formed from constructive interference of multiple waves. These are observed as particles.

---

## 3. Structure of Emergence

### 3.1 Particles
Particles are **resonant knots** — dynamic structures formed by intersecting waves of various frequencies, phases, and amplitudes.

- Stability arises from **harmonic reinforcement**.
- Charge arises from **coupling symmetry**.
- Spin results from **rotational standing wave symmetry**.

### 3.2 Fields
Fields are **zones of recurrent wave resonance** — regions where certain waveforms propagate efficiently due to environmental conditions in Tarangi.

### 3.3 Forces
Interactions occur through **phase coupling**:

- Attraction: **Phase-locking**
- Repulsion: **Phase mismatch or dephasing**
- Strong/weak forces: **Localized phase interaction dynamics**

No "forces" exist fundamentally — only resonance-driven adjustments.

## 4. Spacetime and Gravity

### 4.1 Spacetime
Spacetime is not an independent geometry but the **metric of wave propagation** in Tarangi. The substrate itself unfolds dynamically through the interference of waves.

### 4.2 Gravity
Gravity emerges from **constructive wave interference zones**:

- Massive objects create coherent phase fields.
- These fields **bend** nearby wave trajectories — perceived as gravity.
- No need for curvature of a separate spacetime manifold.

---

## 5. Time, Entropy, and Thermodynamics

### 5.1 Time
Time is not a flowing dimension but the **increasing entanglement of waveforms**.

- Low entropy: Simple wave configurations
- High entropy: Complex interference patterns
- Time’s arrow: Emergent from net increase in resonance complexity

### 5.2 Heat
Heat is the **average deviation of wave resonance** in a region — not kinetic motion, but phase irregularity.

### 5.3 Entropy
Entropy is the **statistical expansion of resonance states** in Tarangi. It is not a "measure of disorder," but a **growth in waveform complexity**.

---

## 6. Cosmology

### 6.1 Black Holes
Black holes are **extreme resonance traps**:

- No escape occurs due to **inward-reflective resonance geometry**.
- Hawking radiation = **loss of edge coherence**, not "particles tunneling out."

### 6.2 Dark Matter
Dark matter consists of **uncharged resonant knots** — stable, non-radiating interference patterns that influence surrounding wave behavior gravitationally.

### 6.3 Dark Energy
Dark energy is the **residual tension of the Tarangi substrate**, which unfolds spatial zones over time as large-scale resonances dissipate.

## 7. Reinterpreting Existing Theories

| Conventional Theory | Trōṇa Siddhāntam Reinterpretation |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)** | Fields are zones of stable resonance, not independent entities [1] |
| **Copenhagen Interpretation** | Collapse is reconfiguration; probabilities are due to limited resolution [2][3] |
| **Standard Model Mass** | Mass is trapped resonance energy, not Higgs coupling [4] |
| **Higgs Boson** | High-order excitation mode, not the cause of mass [4] |
| **General Relativity** | Gravity is phase-guided motion, not curvature [5][6] |
| **E = mc²** | Mass is localized energy from wave compression in a Trōṇa [7] |
| **Superposition** | Result of overlapping wave modes, not probability amplitudes [3] |
| **Entanglement** | Substrate phase-linking, not non-locality [2] |

---

## 8. Experimental Predictions

See [docs/experiments.md] for complete tests.

Key predictions:
- No graviton detection (gravity = resonance geometry)
- No field collapse (only wave recombination)
- Stable particle types obey harmonic ratios
- Vacuum tension varies based on resonance fields
- Galaxy rotation curves can be modeled as wave systems without dark matter particles

---

## 9. Mathematical Development (In Progress)

- Trōṇa Siddhāntam suggests future mathematical formalism may emerge from:
  - Nonlinear wave equations
  - Soliton theory
  - Resonant manifold dynamics
  - Generalized Helmholtz structures in evolving media
- Mathematically precise modeling is deferred to future collaborative work.

## 10. Conclusion

**Trōṇa Siddhāntam** offers a wave-first ontology capable of unifying disparate areas of physics without introducing exotic particles, dimensions, or new constants. It relies on well-studied wave behaviors — resonance, phase-locking, interference — as foundational principles. The theory encourages rethinking known phenomena in terms of **geometric and statistical wave patterns**, offering both simplicity and elegance.
